# React Keyboard Component

## Description

Interactive Keyboard widget built with React.js and styled with styled-components. The inspiration for this project came from a previous project, where my team struggled to find a keyboard component that responded to user keystrokes. At the time, creating our own seemed like a daunting task, so we ended up scrapping the feature. As I've grown as a developer, I took on this project and created a widget that I will incorporate into the latest version of our Typing Test Application. From this project, I gained a good understanding of CSS grid and look forward to implementing it in to more projects.

## Disclaimers
Keyboard is only responsive on screen size > 950px and some of the keys overflow behind others when they are pressed. Future development will prioritize these issues, but for the current use case they will suffice because smaller screen typically have on screen keyboards, which would obstruct this widget.
